# QuizBuzz-Application (Desktop Quiz Application)
A quiz application built using Java FXML. It allows teachers to login using their ID and then create quizzes that can be stored in a database. Students can log in to the application and attempt these quizzes. They are also provided with their scores at the end. 

## Pre-requisites
You need the following items installed on your system to get started.
* An IDE for JAVA (I used NetBeans)
* If you want to create your own designs using FXML then use JAVAFX to create interfaces without coding.
* An active SQL connection within NetBeans (or any IDE of your choice). Check database.java file for database requirements. Database name = "quizDB"

## Pre-defined Login ID's
Following ID's for students and teachers have been pre-defined. You can use these to check the working of the application. A new version will include sign up functionality as well.
* Student ID = "jawwad" , Student Password = "1"
* Instructor ID = "shamyl" , Instructor Password = "1"

## Running The Application
Once you have all completed the checklist for the pre-requisites, you need to run the QuizApp.java file from your IDE. Once agai, you need to have a running SQL connection in your IDE.
